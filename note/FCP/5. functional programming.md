# Functional programming

- Functional programming is an approach to software development based around the evaluation of functions.

- Functional programming follows a few core principles:

Functions are independent from the state of the program or global variables. They only depend on the arguments passed into them to make a calculation
Functions try to limit any changes to the state of the program and avoid changes to the global objects holding data
Functions have minimal side effects in the program

- The functional programming software development approach breaks a program into small, testable parts. This section covers basic functional programming principles in JavaScript.

1. Learn About Functional Programming

- Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope.

- INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT

- Functional programming is about:

  - 1. Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

  - 2. Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

  - 3. Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

2. Understand Functional Programming Terminology

- Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in filter, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.
- Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called first class functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.
- The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called higher order functions.
- When the functions are passed in to another function or returned from another function, then those functions which gets passed in or returned can be called a lambda.

3. Understand the Hazards of Using Imperative Code 다시 !!

- Functional programming is a good habit. It keeps your code easy to manage, and saves you from sneaky bugs.

- But before we get there, let's look at an imperative approach to programming to highlight where you may have issues.
- an imperative style in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task.

- Often the statements change the state of the program, like updating global variables. A classic example is writing a for loop that gives exact directions to iterate over the indices of an array.

- In contrast, functional programming is a form of declarative programming. You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.

- JavaScript offers many predefined methods that handle common tasks so you don't need to write out how the computer should perform them. For example, instead of using the for loop mentioned above, you could call the map method which handles the details of iterating over an array. This helps to avoid semantic errors, like the "Off By One Errors" that were covered in the Debugging section.

- Consider the scenario: you are browsing the web in your browser, and want to track the tabs you have opened. Let's try to model this using some simple object-oriented code.
  이해가 잘 안됨..

```js
// tabs is an array of titles of each site open within the window
var Window = function (tabs) {
  this.tabs = tabs; // We keep a record of the array inside the object
};

// When you join two windows into one window
Window.prototype.join = function (otherWindow) {
  this.tabs = this.tabs.concat(otherWindow.tabs);
  return this;
};

// When you open a new tab at the end
Window.prototype.tabOpen = function (tab) {
  this.tabs.push("new tab"); // Let's open a new tab for now
  return this;
};

// When you close a tab
Window.prototype.tabClose = function (index) {
  // Only change code below this line

  var tabsBeforeIndex = this.tabs.slice(0, index); // Get the tabs before the tab
  var tabsAfterIndex = this.tabs.slice(index + 1); // Get the tabs after the tab

  this.tabs = tabsBeforeIndex.concat(tabsAfterIndex); // Join them together

  // Only change code above this line

  return this;
};

// Let's create three browser windows
var workWindow = new Window([
  "GMail",
  "Inbox",
  "Work mail",
  "Docs",
  "freeCodeCamp",
]); // Your mailbox, drive, and other work sites
var socialWindow = new Window(["FB", "Gitter", "Reddit", "Twitter", "Medium"]); // Social sites
var videoWindow = new Window(["Netflix", "YouTube", "Vimeo", "Vine"]); // Entertainment sites

// Now perform the tab opening, closing, and other operations
var finalTabs = socialWindow
  .tabOpen() // Open a new tab for cat memes
  .join(videoWindow.tabClose(2)) // Close third tab in video window, and join
  .join(workWindow.tabClose(1).tabOpen());
console.log(finalTabs.tabs);
```

4.  Avoid Mutations and Side Effects Using Functional Programming

- Unfortunately, splice changes the original array it is called on, so the second call to it used a modified array, and gave unexpected results.

- One of the core principles of functional programming is to not change things. Changes lead to bugs. It's easier to prevent bugs knowing that your functions don't change anything, including the function arguments or any global variable.

- The previous example didn't have any complicated operations but the splice method changed the original array, and resulted in a bug.
- Recall that in functional programming, changing or altering things is called mutation, and the outcome is called a side effect. A function, ideally, should be a pure function, meaning that it does not cause any side effects.

```js
// The global variable
var fixedValue = 4;

function incrementer() {
  // Only change code below this line
  return fixedValue + 1;
  // Only change code above this line
}
let newValue = incrementer();
console.log(fixedValue); //4
console.log(newValue); //5
```

5. Pass Arguments to Avoid External Dependence in a Function

- The last challenge was a step closer to functional programming principles, but there is still something missing.
- We didn't alter the global variable value, but the function incrementer would not work without the global variable fixedValue being there.
- Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. This means if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument.
- There are several good consequences from this principle. The function is easier to test, you know exactly what input it takes, and it won't depend on anything else in your program.
- This can give you more confidence when you alter, remove, or add new code. You would know what you can or cannot change and you can see where the potential traps are.

- Finally, the function would always produce the same output for the same set of inputs, no matter what part of the code executes it.

```js
// The global variable
var fixedValue = 4;

// Only change code below this line
function incrementer(number) {
  return number + 1;

  // Only change code above this line
}
console.log(incrementer(fixedValue));
console.log(fixedValue);
```

6. Refactor Global Variables Out of Functions

- So far, we have seen two distinct principles for functional programming:

  1. Don't alter a variable or object - create new variables and objects and return them if need be from a function.

  2. Declare function arguments - any computation inside a function depends only on the arguments, and not on any global object or variable.

```js
// The global variable
var bookList = [
  "The Hound of the Baskervilles",
  "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies",
  "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica",
  "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae",
];

// Change code below this line
function add(arr, bookName) {
  let arrCopy = [...arr];
  arrCopy.push(bookName);
  return arrCopy;
  // Change code above this line
}

// Change code below this line
function remove(arr, bookName) {
  let arrCopy = [...arr];
  var book_index = arrCopy.indexOf(bookName);
  if (book_index >= 0) {
    arrCopy.splice(book_index, 1);
    return arrCopy;
    // Change code above this line
  }
}

var newBookList = add(bookList, "A Brief History of Time");
console.log(newBookList);
var newerBookList = remove(bookList, "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies");
console.log(newerBookList);
var newestBookList = remove(
  add(bookList, "A Brief History of Time"),
  "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies"
);
console.log(newestBookList);
```

7. Use the map Method to Extract Data from an Array

- It would make sense to be able to pass them as arguments to other functions, and return a function from another function. Functions are considered `first class objects` in JavaScript, which means they can be used like any other object. They can be saved in variables, stored in an object, or passed as function arguments.
- Let's start with some simple array functions, which are methods on the array object prototype. In this exercise we are looking at Array.prototype.map(), or more simply map.
- The map method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on each element. It does this without mutating the original array.
- See below for an example using the map method on the users array to return a new array containing only the names of the users as elements. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.

```js
const users = [
  { name: "John", age: 34 },
  { name: "Amy", age: 20 },
  { name: "camperCat", age: 10 },
];

const names = users.map((user) => user.name);
console.log(names); // [ 'John', 'Amy', 'camperCat' ]
```

8. Implement map on a Prototype

- the map method returns an array of the same length as the one it was called on.
- It also doesn't alter the original array, as long as its callback function doesn't.
- In other words, map is a pure function, and its output depends solely on its inputs. Plus, it takes another function as its argument.
- You might learn a lot about the map method if you implement your own version of it. It is recommended you use a for loop or Array.prototype.forEach().

```js
// The global variable
var s = [23, 65, 98, 5];

Array.prototype.myMap = function (callback) {
  var newArray = [];
  // Only change code below this line
  for (let element of s) {
    newArray.push(callback(element));
  }
  // Only change code above this line
  return newArray;
};

var new_s = s.myMap(function (item) {
  return item * 2;
});
```

```js
// The global variable
var s = [23, 65, 98, 5];

Array.prototype.myMap = function (callback) {
  var newArray = [];
  // Only change code below this line
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    newArray.push(callback(s[i]));
  }
  // Only change code above this line
  return newArray;
};

var new_s = s.myMap(function (item) {
  return item * 2;
});
```

```js
// The global variable
var s = [23, 65, 98, 5];

Array.prototype.myMap = function (callback) {
  var newArray = [];
  // Only change code below this line
  s.forEach((element) => newArray.push(callback(element)));
  // Only change code above this line
  return newArray;
};

var new_s = s.myMap(function (item) {
  return item * 2;
});
```

9. Use the filter Method to Extract Data from an Array

- filter calls a function on each element of an array and returns a new array containing only the elements for which that function returns true. In other words, it filters the array, based on the function passed to it. Like map, it does this without needing to modify the original array.

- The callback function accepts three arguments.
- The first argument is the current element being processed.
- The second is the index of that element
- the third is the array upon which the filter method was called.

- See below for an example using the filter method on the users array to return a new array containing only the users under the age of 30. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.

```js
const users = [
  { name: "John", age: 34 },
  { name: "Amy", age: 20 },
  { name: "camperCat", age: 10 },
];

const usersUnder30 = users.filter((user) => user.age < 30);
console.log(usersUnder30); // [ { name: 'Amy', age: 20 }, { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 } ]
```

question answer

```js
var filteredList = watchList
  .map((movie) => {
    return { title: movie.Title, rating: movie.imdbRating };
  })
  .filter((movie) => movie.rating > 8.0);
```

10. Implement the filter Method on a Prototype

- You might learn a lot about the filter method if you implement your own version of it. It is recommended you use a for loop or Array.prototype.forEach().

```js
// The global variable
var s = [23, 65, 98, 5];

Array.prototype.myFilter = function (callback) {
  // Only change code below this line
  var newArray = [];
  for (let element of s) {
    if (callback(element) === true) {
      newArray.push(element);
    }
  }
  // Only change code above this line
  return newArray;
};

var new_s = s.myFilter(function (item) {
  return item % 2 === 1;
});
console.log(new_s);
```

```js
// The global variable
var s = [23, 65, 98, 5];

Array.prototype.myFilter = function (callback) {
  // Only change code below this line
  var newArray = [];
  s.forEach((element) => {
    if (callback(element) === true) newArray.push(element);
  });
  // Only change code above this line
  return newArray;
};

var new_s = s.myFilter(function (item) {
  return item % 2 === 1;
});
console.log(new_s);
```
