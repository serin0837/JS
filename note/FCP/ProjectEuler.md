1. Project Euler: Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
   If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the provided parameter value number.

```js serin
function multiplesOf3and5(number) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let currentNum = 1; currentNum < number; currentNum++) {
    if (currentNum % 3 == 0 || currentNum % 5 == 0) {
      sum += currentNum;
    }
  }
  return sum;
}

console.log(multiplesOf3and5(10));
```

2. Even Fibonacci Numbers
   Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed n, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```js serin
function fiboEvenSum(n) {
  let previousNum = 1;
  let currentNum = 2;
  let sum = 0;
  while (currentNum <= n) {
    currentNum += previousNum;
    previousNum = currentNum - previousNum;
    console.log(currentNum, previousNum);
    if (previousNum % 2 === 0) {
      sum += previousNum;
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
console.log(fiboEvenSum(10));
```
