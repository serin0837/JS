A square of squares
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

-1 => false
0 => true
3 => false
4 => true
25 => true
26 => false

```js
var isSquare = function (n) {
  const square = Math.sqrt(n);
  if (Number.isInteger(square) && square >= 0) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};
```

```js other
function isSquare(n) {
  return Math.sqrt(n) % 1 === 0;
}

const isSquare = (n) => Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(n));
```
